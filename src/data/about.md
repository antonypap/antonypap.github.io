# Introduction

I'm a *Machine Learning Engineer* and *Software Engineer* with a knack for solving tough technical problems and turning them into impactful solutions.
I'm always drawn to the challenges that push me to learn and grow, especially in the fields of *AI* and *software development*.
Whether it's building smart systems or diving deep into algorithms, I'm all about using technology to make a meaningful difference.

# Background

I hold an MSc in Applied Machine Learning from Imperial College London, where I primarily focused on areas like Machine Learning Safety, AI Multi-Agent Systems, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.
This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my enthusiasm for leveraging AI to tackle real-world challenges.
Before that, I completed a joint BSc and MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA, focusing on computer science, mathematics, and the fundamentals of software and data engineering.
A memorable highlight of my academic journey was my semester abroad at PoliMi, which really broadened my international horizons and gave me fresh perspectives on technology and culture.

# Experience

In the industry, I've taken on diverse roles that have shaped me into a well-rounded engineer, both as a Software Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer.
I've worked with a wide range of technologies - from Python, JavaScript, and Java, to cloud services like AWS and containerization tools like Docker - always aiming to create reliable, scalable solutions.  

I'm deeply invested in AI research that goes beyond just theory, aiming for practical applications that can address real-world problems.
My work is driven by the desire to bridge the gap between innovative research and practical implementation.

# Outtake

I'm constantly seeking new challenges that allow me to grow, push boundaries, and make a lasting impact.
If there's one thing I've learned, it's that collaboration and continuous learning are the keys to turning bold ideas into reality.
